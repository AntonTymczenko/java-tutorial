Create a JAVA game as described below.

The program displays a window with a panel taking the most part of a window and
a label at the bottom. The label has a border with a title "Score". The text
of the label is something like "Current score: 50%". The window is about
400x450 px in size.

The panel is filled with a color. On the top of that color, in random places,
there appear squares of contrasting (to the panel background) color. Squares
fall from the position where they appear downwards. The player has to “kill”
them by clicking on them before they reach the bottom edge of the panel.
Squares clicked and squares reaching the bottom edge disappear.
The current score is constantly shown on the label — this may be the fraction,
in percents, of the number of squares which have not reached the bottom relative
to the total number of squares created.

After a prescribed time, for example a minute, the game is over: squares stop
falling, new ones are not created any more and an appropriate message is shown.
The message is show in a pop-up window with a button "OK" which closes the app.

What to show in the message - is whether the player lost or won. The player wins
if the fraction displayed on the label is still higher than a prescribed
value (say 50%).

Set the parameters of the game, like how frequently new squares are created,
their speed, time of the game, and the required winning score so the game is
not too easy but still it is possible to win.
